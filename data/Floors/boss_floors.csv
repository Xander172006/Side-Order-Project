Boss,Icon,Description
Pinging Marciale,,"The Pinging Marciale is a large Jelleton similar to both the Rampaging Octowhirl and an 8-ball. Its arena has bumpers at the edges; if the Pinging Marciale hits them, a Wave Breaker-like shockwave will spawn when it hits the ground, many Jelletons are summoned, and the Pinging Marciale will periodically lose its outer shell, exposing weak points that the player can hit to deal more damage."
Asynchronous Rondo,,"The Asynchronous Rondo has layers that rotate around itself, with rectangular weak points that slightly protrude from each layer. The player must defeat it by knocking down each glowing layer, while avoiding floodlights, Jelletons, and bombs summoned by the boss."
Parallel Canon,,"Parallel Canon takes the form of Jelleton-like ink blobs in the shape of Inklings that attack using weapons, resembling Splatoon's playable characters. The boss is fought in three waves of one to five such creatures at a time. Its appearance can be influenced by the player's Splatoon 2 save data previously imported, specifically the appearance of their Agent 4."
Marina Agitando,,"Marina Agitando serves as the tutorial boss, using mobile portals to keep a barrier up, and using speakers to fire off various attacks."
Overlorder,,"Overlorder serves as the final boss of a climb, being a Jelleton Octopus who uses mobile portals to protect itself through a barrier, and will fire off attacks including tentacle slamming and Special Weapons."
